			<Page>Thanks to some recent  <![CDATA[<i>]]>repairs<![CDATA[</i>]]> on the space suits the thrusters no longer work properly <![CDATA[<size=20>]]>(I'm looking at you Slate)<![CDATA[</size>]]></Page>
			<Page>So now the OUTER WILDS VENTURES space program requires its astrounauts to learn a new skill, climbing!</Page>
			<Page>To do it you need to: \\n     1.     Get close to a wall.\\n     2.     Climb said wall.\\n     3.     Act as if you where flying the suit.\\n</Page>
			<Page>Double-sided tape was added to the suits to allow better adhesion into surfaces, so don't forget it</Page>
			<Page>You can also jump from the wall while you are climbing if needed</Page>
